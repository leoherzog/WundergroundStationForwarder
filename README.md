# Station Forwarder

This code is built to be hosted on the free [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform. It takes in weather station data from:

- [IBM Wunderground](https://wunderground.com/member/api-keys),
- [MyAcurite](https://myacurite.com/),
- [Davis WeatherLink](https://weatherlink.com/),
- [WeatherFlow Tempest](https://tempestwx.com/),
- [Ambient Weather](https://ambientweather.net/),
- [Ecowitt](https://ecowitt.net/),
- [aprs.fi (CWOP)](https://aprs.fi/), or
- a custom data source in [RTL_433 JSON format](https://www.triq.org/rtl_433/DATA_FORMAT.html),

and periodically sends it on to

- [IBM Wunderground](https://wunderground.com/pws/overview),
- [Windy.com](https://stations.windy.com/),
- [Aeris PWSWeather](https://pwsweather.com/),
- [WeatherCloud](https://weathercloud.com/),
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/stations),
- [WindGuru](https://www.windguru.cz/map/station/),
- [MET (UK) WOW](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/) and/or
- [NOAA CWOP](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_cwop.shtml).

## Setup

1. Create a new [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) project and give it a name

  Creation of a new OpenWeatherMap station must be done by API, not on the OpenWeatherMap website. More information is available in [the OpenWeatherMap Station API documentation](https://openweathermap.org/stations#create_station). The basic concept for what must be done is available in the `createNewOWMStation_()` function. Remove the `_` character from the name of that function to make it selectable from the `â–· Run` button in the toolbar. If you do so, make sure you note your new station's ID and other details in the log (available in the Executions tab in the sidebar after running!), then:

  - Set `updateOpenWeatherMap` to `true` on Line 59
  - Set `openWeatherMapAPIKey` to your [API Key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) on Line 60
  - Set your `openWeatherMapStationId` to [your OpenWeatherMap station's `external_id`](https://openweathermap.org/stations#create_station) on line 61
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>WindGuru</summary>

  Send to [WindGuru](https://www.windguru.cz/map/station/):

  Start by [registering a new "Other / Upload API" station](https://stations.windguru.cz/register.php?id_type=16), then:

  - Set `windGuruStationUID` to your chosen [station UID](https://stations.windguru.cz/) on Line 64
  - Set your `windGuruStationPassword` to your chosen [station API password](https://stations.windguru.cz/) (note, not your _account's_ password) on line 65
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Met (UK) WOW</summary>

  Send to [The Met Office's Weather Observations Website](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/):

  Start by [registering a new Site](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/sites/create). During registration, one of the fields in your Site's options is "Authentication Key". Choose any 6-Digit number. Then:

  - Set `updateWOW` to `true` on Line 67
  - Set `wowSiteID` to the generated [Site ID](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/sites) on Line 68
  - Set `wowAuthKey` to your chosen [6-Digit Authentication Key](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/sites) that you chose when creating or editing the Site on line 69
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>NOAA Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP)</summary>

  Send to [CWOP](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_cwop.shtml). Start by [registering for a new station](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_cwop.shtml), then when you receive your email:

  - Set `updateCWOP` to `true` on Line 71
  - Set `cwopStationIDOrHamCallsign` to your assigned CWOP station ID that you received via email on Line 72
  - If you are using your ham radio callsign as your station ID and you have received a validation code from NOAA CWOP support, set `cwopValidationCode` to your validation code on Line 73
  </details>

4. Run the "Schedule" function (not the "doPost" function) by selecting "Schedule" in the dropdown and pressing the `â–· Run` button in the toolbar. You're done! You can see it periodically running in the `â˜°â–¶` Executions tab on the left sidebar. This code is executed on Google's servers and does not require a computer to remain on.

If you ever make changes to the API keys or enabled services, just run the **Schedule** function again.

## How to Update

1. Copy the code from [`code.gs`](https://github.com/leoherzog/WundergroundStationForwarder/blob/latest/code.gs) in this release over your `Code.gs` file.
2. Make sure your API Keys and settings at the top of the file are correct and `ðŸ’¾ Save`.
3. Run the `Schedule` function again with the `â–· Run` button in the toolbar.
